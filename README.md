# Everybite
Nowadays, along with more and more food journal apps, people who use them tend to feel guity when they are notified by those apps that they consume too many calories. This is one of important reasons causing users decide to give up food journaling in a very short time trying. So this project for individual study aims to develop an iOS app which could let users record food intake easily and provide users with an overview of their eat habits.

Intuitively, we know that colors equal health and that the more colors that were eathen, the better it probably was to overall health. So the main function of Everybite is to take photos of your each meal and display color bars of your daily food intake. In that way, people can know their eatting pattern visually by viewing the variety of food colors on Calendar, and they would not feel pressure due to calories.
